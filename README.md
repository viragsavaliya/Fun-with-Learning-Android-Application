# Fun-with-Learning-Android-Application
The project aims to deliver an application that will be available on android mobile devices. There are some kindergarten level lessons in this application. This can be an initial step-parent can take to teach their kids before they go to school. Children can easily learn basic things while having fun, such as alphabets, numbers, and colours, and so on, all through some rhymes.
